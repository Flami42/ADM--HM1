# ADM--HM1

This is the repository of my ADM-Homwrork 1.

I found many BUGS in Hackerrannk that costed me the correct evaluation of some exercises, even if my code is as expected. Indeed in the submissions pages you will see some exercises with lot of "Wrong Answer", when the expected aswer was the one one my code provided.
