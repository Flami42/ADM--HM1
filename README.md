# ADM--HM1

This is the repository of my ADM-Homework 1.

I found many BUGS in Hackerrank that costed me the correct evaluation of many exercises, even if my code is as expected. Indeed in the submissions pages you will see some exercises with lot of "Wrong Answer" or "Runtime Error", when the expected aswer was the one my code provided.
